## Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up**: User provides their username, email, and password to create a new account. After submission, they are automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard.
2. **Login**: User provides their username/email and password to log in to the app.
3. **Forgot Password**: User enters their email address to receive instructions on how to reset their password.
4. **Change Password**: User can change their password after logging in by providing their old and new passwords.
5. **Dashboard**: The authenticated user is greeted by their username and has the option to go to their profile or change their password.
6. **Profile**: Displays the user's personal information, including their username, email, and account creation date.
